                    Staying up to date with the latest technology has become a requirement to be a productive member 
                    of the society these days. Especially for the young generations. 
                    Peers having the latest smartphones and gadgets whereas you are using a flip phone.
                    This could be a nightmare for the young generations.
                    Even the newborns are using smartphone in some way.
                    You can see children asking their parents gadgets. 
                    The case of them knowing more about the gadgets than the parents themselves.
                    The rate of advancement in the technology has been unimaginable.
                    This is due to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mooreslaw.asp">Moore's Law</a> 
                    which states that the number of transistors on a microchip will double every two years. 
                    This isn’t a law but is an expectation from the current engineers who have so far fulfilled it.
                    Technology has impacted the lifestyle of people. Social Medias to jobs.
                    Technology has changed everything. New jobs that were unimaginable a decade ago.
                    YouTubers like Pewdiepie make millions by posting gameplay videos on YouTube.

                    From using flip phones to touchscreen phones we all grew up. Now I can do almost all my essentials from my phone. I still remember my math teacher saying “You need to be quick in mental math. You won’t take everywhere you go or do shopping”. Boy was he wrong. Now almost everybody has a phone in their pocket which has an app called calculator. For entertainment, I watch videos in YouTube. To check the study material and class schedule I use google classroom. The phone has even replaced dictionary and encyclopedia. A quick google search and done. The camera in phones has been so good that it has replaced cameras for normal users. Basic editing apps can make photos look so much better.

                    The use of internet in these devices has made its uses far more broad than it was at first made for. The internet has brought people much closer than before. We can easily chat with our best friends about how much we hate to do our assignments, share links to latest gossips, songs, etc. Parents learning about video chatting has become a curse as before you were forced to talk to that annoying aunt that mom keeps talking hours on the phone. Now, you have to show your face and make an effort to look interested in her stories and laugh at every corny joke she makes. It makes you remember the good old days of voice call. The transfer of data and information has been so much easier and faster than ever.

                    Technology has done many wonderful. It has sent humankind to moon. And the Internet has revolutionized the communication technology. From mails to file transfer, the internet has done wonders. For the introverts like me, online shopping has been the gift from the Gods. In the transportation sector, the immersion of apps like pathao, tootle, etc has made people’s lives easier. Previously, if people had to hurry up to go somewhere without their personal vehicles, they either had to wait for buses and hustle with the crowd to get a sit or stand up which felt like hours or pay the taxis almost fifty times the amount to the taxis. But now, a simple request for pickup and a driver in a bike comes to pick you up. The fare is far more reasonable. The way of studying has also been changed. The days of paying huge amounts for books that you study 2-3 pages of for the exams are slowing becoming things of the past. Google Scholars and website like w3schools, YouTube, Skillshare has made a new way of learning skills from the internet. All the datas can be now stored in cloud which is secured and can be accessed anywhere with internet connection.

                    Technology has done many good but as the saying goes "There's always a catch". It has negative aspects as well. Technology has made new types of crimes like identity theft, ransom ware, catfishing someone. Online bullying is a real problem and people have even committed suicide due to it. Even though social Medias like twitter has given us a platform to show our views and opinions, some people have been fired or have used it to harass other people. Ransom ware which encrypts the data in the computer and says the victim to pay the sum to the hacker to decrypt the data is to the rise. Catfishing someone and destroying their reputation is also at high. So many people have become addicted to their phones and the internet that they do not like to socialize. Online games like Pubg, Fornite has become so addictive to people that people have died playing games for weeks without sleep, water and food. DarkWeb makes a lot of illegal things like selling drugs, human trafficking easier as it cannot be tracked and traced back to people.

                    Technology has done wonders for human kind. But should be used properly and carefully. Technology in today’s world is unavoidable but being productive using it is an option and should be the priority.
